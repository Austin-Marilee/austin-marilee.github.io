					<h1>MAIN FORK OF THE SALMON, IDAHO</h1>
					<p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return, winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of those that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.</p>

					<p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest un-damned rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. </p>

					<p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hill sides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</p>

				<p><strong>Class I - X:</strong><br>the Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X (1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I-V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
